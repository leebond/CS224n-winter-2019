Explore assignments completed by me in those folders named
/aN N = 1 to 5

Stay tuned with me as I complete the assignments biweekly.

Update:
I've completed Week 4's lecture and the code implementation part of the assignment! Will skip the written part of the assignment as they are analytical and will continue the lectures. Also, I've provided a "walkthrough" of assignment 4 to gain a deeper understanding of the NMT code implementation.
